## Description

It represents the first step towards building a full web application.

This first step consists of:

- a custom command-line interface for data management,
- and the base classes for the storage of this data.

## Usage ðŸ’»

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.
It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.
